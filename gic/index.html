<li><a href="transferfn/transferfn_demo.htm">transferfn_demo</a> - Comparison between a direct (no smoothing) frequency domain method and a time domain method for estimating a causal and absolutely integrable transfer function.</li>
<li><a href="transferfn/transferfn_demo2.htm">transferfn_demo2</a> - Comparison of time and frequency domain approaches to estimating the transfer function for an infinite half-plane (which is causal and not absolutely integrable).  Shows limitations in time domain method and appearance of acausal terms in frequency domain due to DFT approximation.</li>
<li><a href="transferfn/transferfn_demo3.htm">transferfn_demo3</a> - Comparison between time domain and commonly used frequency domain methods for estimating transfer functions for use in prediction.  Demonstrates use of functions transferfnFD and transferfnTD for computing transfer functions.</li>
