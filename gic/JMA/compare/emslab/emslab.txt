The EMSLAB time series data may be used for research and analysis purposes provided
that you agree to the following caveats:
(1) On any publication resulting from any use of this data, I am invited to be
    a co-author. However, should you make any statements in the publication
    with which I do not agree, and should we be unable to come to some
    compromise, then I will only require that the data source be acknowledged.
    I am prepared to work with you in a co-operative manner if you so desire.
(2) This data is given on a "caveat emptor" basis. There are still "glitches"
    in it,mainly "steps" as discussed for sites EMSL02, EMSL05 & EMSL11. I
    have tried to clean it up as much as I can.
(3) You inform me that you have downloaded the data.
(4) You inform me of any major corrections to the data that you make. This
    is so that I can keep an updated error file for distribution.

DATA
====
 
The 5 field components were sampled at 20 s, and the data are stored between
hour markers, which are on the hour. The data are multiplexed, and are stored
in the order Hx(H), Hy(D), Hz(Z), Ex(N), Ey(E), in units of 1/10 nT and
1/10 mV/km respectively.
 
The data format is a "header" record, giving the 6-character station code
followed by a 10-character hour time (yymmddhhmm), followed by 60 records
giving the data for that hour in 15I5. The first data points AFTER the hour
mark are for one digitizing interval later.
Thus the data for the hour beginning 1 pm on 16th September, 1985, for station
MF1.01 (EMSL01) looks like:-
 
EMSL018509161300
   26  615   53   93  195   21  615   53   97  195   24  617   56   93  187
   24  620   56  102  184   24  625   58  102  176   26  634   63  115  161
etc.
where the Hx field at 13:00:20 is  2.6 nT
          Hy                      61.5 nT
          Hz                       5.3 nT
          Ex                       9.3 mV/km
          Ey                      19.5 mV/km
 
The missing data marker (caused either by cassette changing, no data, off-scale
components, or data deleted by myself because of known errors) is  -9999.
 
The data are in GEOMAGNETIC co-ordinates, and an appropriate general
declination value to use for all sites is  -19.5,  i.e., 19.5 degrees anti-
clockwise, to rotate into geographical co-ordinates.
 
 
 
 
INSTRUMENTS
===========
 
Magnetometers: EDA Fluxgates,
               sensitivity of approx. 0.25 nT,
               Filters: HiPass -3dB points at 40 s
                       no LoPass filters used,
                       (NOTE: the objective of these data were to give the MT
                       responses out to 30000 s, so not all sites were
                       sufficiently well protected to permit estimation of the
                       GDS transfer functions much beyond that due to thermal
                       effects. Please contact me for more information on this
                       point if you wish to derive very long period GDS
                       transfer functions)
 
Tellurometers: generally 100 m dipoles, Pb-PbCO4 electrodes, X-array
               configuration, contact to the ground ensured by using a
               conducting jelly (amorphous silicate, salt & water)
               sensitivity of typically 0.25 nV/km,
               Filters: HiPass -3dB points at 40 s
                        LoPass -3dB points at 30000 s
               ***Additional HiPass filters on the telluric channels
                  at both 1s and 10s. Thus there are three (3) HiPass
                  filter stages, each of 2-pole Butterworth
 
Recorders: DATEL cassette recorders with a 12 bit A/D
           timing (by an hour mark) to better than 20 s with less than 20 s
                  drift over one week
           cassettes changed weekly (precise time of change available on
                  request)
 
Filters: 2-pole Butterworth filters with matched components such that the
         filters can be characterized to better than 1% by their -3dB points.
         See APPENDIX 1 for information on how to remove the filter response
         from the cross-spectra
 
System Box: An aluminium box with 2 inches of insulation on the sides and
            bottom, and 4 inches of insulation on the top. Tests by Lawrie Law
            and Ron Kurtz indicate that this insulation is equivalent to about
            1 - 2 feet of earth.
 
 
 
SITE INFORMATION
================
 
 
Site MF1.01 (EMSL01); Drat Creek     44 54.2N  123 55.1W   (10.6 km from coast)
===============================================================================
 
Site located in a wood with head buried well and system box well shaded.
Unfortunately there was a small prking area nearby (within 100 m) so that
there may be very occassional noise on the magnetic channels due to traffic
18 July - 22 Sept continuous.
Data of generally high quality with few problems, occassional offsets (See
EMSL02).
 
The following list gives on the first record:-
(a) the station (EMSL01)
(b) the time interval for which these calibration settings and filter -3dB
    points are valid (8507072345-8507180115)
(c) the number of channels (5)
(d) the MT system used (MT#9),
(e) the magnetometer used (31)
(f) the tellurometer used (0841)
(g) the Datel used (1029)
followed by five records, one for each component, giving:-
(a) the component name
(b) the calibration factor (NOTE: do not use as this data is in field values)
(c) the LoPass -3dB point
(d) the HiPass -3dB point (NOTE: no HiPass filters on magnetic channels)
(e1) the magnetometer calibration factor, or
(e2) the dipole length followed by the gain factor on the tellurometer
(f) the Datel calibration factor

Site MF1.02 (EMSL02); Gravel Creek   44 53.5N  123 46.5W   (19.3 km from coast)
===============================================================================
 
Site very isolated in a wood with the head well buried and the system box well
shaded.
25 July - 22 Sept. missing 1 - 7 August.
Many offsets in the data caused by sticking bits on the Datel recorder used.
These offsets have been removed in an automatic manner by first-differencing,
de-spiking, then first-integrating. This method looses the baseline such that
successive cassettes of data may have a different "zero" line. Thus, if you
intend to interpolate over a cassette change missing data interval, you must
consider that there will probably be a "step" as well.

Site MF1.04 (EMSL04); Black Rock     44 51.2N  123 31.6W   (40.0 km from coast)
===============================================================================
 
Site located in an open old logging cut with is relativelt flat in the EW
direction but does have a gradient estimated at some 4 m over the NS dipole.
Thus there will be topographic effects on the Ex data. The head was reasonably
well buried but the system box was exposed.
24 July - 22 Sept. continuous.
High quality data with few problems.

===============================================================================
 
Site located in a very flat marshy plain within a small valley. The head was
reasonably well buried but the system box was exposed. This should of been
named the "100 DOLLAR SITE" as that was the "fee" I had to pay for the use of
the field.
17 July - 22 Sept. missing 24 - 31 July.
Serious offsets as for Site EMSL02

Site located in the unused corner of a hay field.
18 July - 22 Sept. missing 24 - 30 July & 6 - 12 August.
This part of the Willammette Valley is so populated that I had to come
off-line to the South, and then had to use an unsatisfactory location just to
the South of the outcropping Salem Hills (expect static-shift effects). The
head was not well buried (the mud was like concrete to dig!) and John Booker
later reburied it; and the electrode lines were as an L-array instead of the
usual X-array configuration. The jelly may have dried out partially during the
experiment, such that the ground contact resistance may have become very high.
Use the telluric data with care; but the magnetic channels are OK.

APPENDIX 1 - Removal of system response from cross-spectra
==========================================================
Note that because the -3dB points are occassionally below the Nyquist
frequency, it is not possible to correct for the instrument response in the
time domain. If you require this then you must apply the correction in the
frequency domain, then inverse Fourier transform.
 
LOW-Pass filter response removal
--------------------------------
Assume we have a cross-spectra between the x & y components at period t
(Sxy(t)), and that the x-channel & y-channel had -3dB low-pass filter points
of tx & ty respectively. Then derive the corrected cross-spectra from:-
 
Sr = real(Sxy(t))
Si = imag(Sxy(t))
Ax = 1. - (tx/t)**2.
Ay = 1. - (ty/t)**2.
Cx = 1.414*(tx/t)
Cy = 1.414*(ty/t)
CORRx = Ax*Ay + Cx*Cy
CORRy = Ax*Cy - Ay*Cx
X = CORRx*Sr - CORRy*Si
Y = CORRy*Sr + CORRx*Si
Sxy(t)_corrected = CMPLX(X,Y)
 
HIGH-Pass filter response removal
---------------------------------
The x-channel & y-channel have -3dB high-pass filter points of tx & ty
respectively. Then derive the corrected cross spectra from:-
 
Sr = real(Sxy(t))
Si = imag(Sxy(t))
Ax = 1. - (t/tx)**2.
Ay = 1. - (t/ty)**2.
Cx = -1.414*(t/tx)
Cy = -1.414*(t/ty)
CORRx = Ax*Ay + Cx*Cy
CORRy = Ax*Cy - Ay*Cx
X = CORRx*Sr - CORRy*Si
Y = CORRy*Sr + CORRx*Si
Sxy(t)_corrected = CMPLX(X,Y)
 
 
APPENDIX 2 - Corrections applied to these data, noted errors, & missing data
============================================================================
 
The following corrections were applied to the Datel bits, not to the field
data, and so to convert these corrections into field values you must:-
(1) take the appropriate calibration factor given above, which convertd Datel
    mV into field values,
(2) multiply this by 5000/2048, which converts the bits to mV
&
(3) multiply the magnetic components only by -1. This compensates for the
    Datel recorder having the highest order bits for negative voltages, which
    introduces a factor of -1 for all channels, and for the fact that we are
    recording potential differences, not electric fields themselves, which
    introduces a factor of -1 for the telluric channels only.
 
Most corretions are for "offsets" caused by bit-sticking of the Datel
recorders. For most recorders this is only a problem for the first hour after
a cassette change, with the exceptions of EMSL02, EMSL05 & EMSL11 (see above).
The corrections and comments are listed in order of site, then in order of the
cassette number (basically week beginning 8507070000), then the start time of
the hour, in format YYMMDDHHMM.
An asterisk (*) following the start time indicates that the comments are for
the whole of that cassette.
The numbers given must be added (or subtracted) to the particular channel for
the whole of the hour, given in the order of the five component
(Hx, Hy, Hz, Ex, Ey).
A correction of -9999 indicates that the data for that component for that hour
was not worth retaining and has thus been deleted and is not subsequently
included in this dataset.
A marker of XXXXX indicates that the data for that component for that hour are
known to be erroneous, but that they have been retained and are in these data.
A "J" indicates that there are known offset jumps on that component for that
hour.
An "N" indicates known noise problems for that hour.
A "+/-" indicates that the sign bit was considered to be in error.
A "x" indicates missing data for that hour.
