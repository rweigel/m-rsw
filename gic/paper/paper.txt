A Comparison of Methods for Estimating the Geoelectric Field in the U.S.

The geoelectric field is the primary input used for estimation of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in conducting systems.  We compare three methods for estimating the geoelectric field given the measured geomagnetic field at 4 locations in the U.S.  The methods include: (1) using a pre--existing 1-D conductivty model (2) a robust and bias--corrected remote reference frequency domain method and (3) a simple frequency domain method.  The quality of the estimations are determined using the histogram and power spectrum of the estimation errors.  It is shown that with respect to these quality metrics, method (1) is not reliable and and often produces average electric field estimation errors that are above that measured and method (either due to over- or under-estimation), (2) produces in general reliable but generally inferior estimations than method (3).

Introduction

Historically, estimation of geoelectric field magnitudes have been made with 1-D conductivity models [REF, REF] as they were the only widely available models of conductivity available. 

 Over the past decade, the EarthScope project has developed transfer functions over a large span of the U.S. and made the transfer functions publicly available [REF].  These transfer functions were developed to model conductivty structures and can in principle be used for the estimation of the geoelectric field.

There is a large body of literature in the magnetotelluluric community on computing surface impedance tensors, $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$, that connect the measured geomagnetic field to the geoelectric field on Earth's surface using $\mathbf{E{\omega}} = \mathbf{Z(\omega}}\mathbf{B(\omega)}$ [\cite{Chave2012} and references therein].  The primariy objective of such estimates is for an impedance tensor that can be used to compute a model of conductivity versus depth. These models are derived with statistical methods that are taylored to reduce bias and increase robustness.  The quantity minimized in developing these models is a weighted sum-of-squares residual, where the weights and data intervals used are based on an iterative process [Simpson and Bahr 2005; \cite{Chave2012} chapter 5].

In contrast, for estimating GICs, which are computed based on the estimated $E(t)$ [REF], the primary objective is to estimate $\mathbf{E}$ given $\mathbf{B}$ with a high degree of accuracy.  The primary assessment of the quality of the estimateion is based generally on the overall match between the predicted and measured time series.  The most common metric for assessing quality is the sum-of-squares error or the sum-of-squares error scaled by the variance of the measurements (ARV), which provides insight into how much of the variance in the data is caputred by the model.  In addition, we also consider the frequency depedence of the error in order to identify situations where, for example, one model may captures higher frequency fluctuations but does not caputre low frequency variations.

It is expected that estimates will depend on the statistical method used to derive the transfer function.  In this work a comparison of how these different methods perform is made.  Of course, models developed to minimize a sum-of-squares residual are expected to outperform models in which the minimization quantity differs.  In this work we quantify the impact of the method of derivation of the transfer function on estimates in terms of both a sum-of-squares residual and also by considering the spectra of estimation errors.

Methods

The three methods for estimating the surface geoelectric field given measurements of the surface geomagnetic field are given below.

Method 1: A surface impedance computed from a pre-existing 1-D model of conductivity, $\sigma$, versus depth, $d$

\begin{equation}
Z_{n}(\omega) = Z_{n}(\omega) = F(\sigma(d),d,\omega)
\end{equation}

where the function $F$ provides the surface impedance from the use of Wait's recursion formula (Wait [1954]; see also formula 2.33 of Simpson and Bahr 2005). $E_x(\omega)$ and $E_y(\omega)$ are computed using

\begin{equation}
E_x(\omega) = Z_n(\omega)B_y(\omega} 
E_y(\omega) = -Z_n(\omega)B_x(\omega} 
\end{equation}

and then $E_x(t)$ and $E_y(t)$ are computed from the inverse fourier transforms of $E_x(\omega)$ and $E_y(\omega)$, respectively.

Method 2: $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ measurements are used to solving for $\mathbf{Z}$ in

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E(\omega)} = \mathbf{Z(\omega)}\mathbf{B(\omega)} 
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{B} = (B_x,B_y)^T, $\mathbf{E} = (E_x,E_y)^T, and

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Z} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_xx & Z_yx
Z_xy & Z_yy
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

using linear least squares regression (Sims 1971; Simpson and Bahr 2005).  In this work, the evaluation freqencies are selected to be logarithmically spaced and the value at each evaluation frequency are determined using a parzen window.  $E_x(t)$ and $E_y(t)$ are computed from the inverse fourier transforms of $E_x(\omega)$ and $E_y(\omega)$, respectively after linear interpolation of the components of $\mathbf{Z}$ on to a uniform frequency grid determined by the length of the series being predicted.

Method 3: Same as method 2 except instead of ordinary linear least squares regression, a robust regression method with auxiliary remote reference measurements is used (Egbert and Booker, 1986; Chave and Thompson 1989).  We have not implemented this alogithm but rather taken the computed impedance tensors from [REF] and used them to compute estimations of $E_x(t)$ and $E_y(t)$ in the same way as method 2.

Data

We consider four intervals for which different 1-D conductivity models exist, $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ measurements are available, and a method 3 conductivity model is available.
