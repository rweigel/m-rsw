A Comparison of Methods for Predicting the Geoelectric Field in the U.S.

We compare and contrast four methods for predicting the geoelectric field given the measured geomagnetic field at N location in the U.S.  The methods include using a pre-existing 1-D conductivty model, (2) a time domain method, (3) a simple frequency domain method, and (4) a robust and bias corrected remote reference frequency domain method.  It is shown that with respect to a sum-of-squares error metric that methods (2) and (3) perform the best.  Method (2) is computationally intensive but produces a causal impulse response.  Method (3) is computationally inexpensive but produces an acause impulse response and cannot produce predictions with lead times as short as method (2).

Introduction

There is a large body of literature in the magnetotelluluric community on computing surface impedance tensors, $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$, that connect the measured geomagnetic field to the geoelectric field on the surface of using $\mathbf{E{\omega}} = \mathbf{Z(\omega}}\mathbf{B(\omega)}$ [\cite{Chave2012} and references therein].  The primariy objective of such estimates is for an impedance tensor that can be used to compute a model of conductivity versus depth; most of the interpretation centers on interpretation $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$. These models are derived with statictial methods that are taylored to reduce bias and increase robustness.  The quantity minimized in developing these models is a weighted sum-of-squares residual, where the weights and data used are based on an iterative process.

In contrast, for predicting GICs, which are computed based on the predicted $E(t)$ [REF], the primary objective is to predict $\mathbf{E}$ given $\mathbf{B}$ with a high degree of accuracy; most of the interpretation centers on the impulse response, $\mathbf{H}$.  The primary assessment of the quality of the prediction is based on the sum-of-squares residual (although many other prediction quality metrics are possible, for example based on the models ability to predict large threshold crossings [\cite{Weigel2006}]).

It is expected that the results of predictability will depend on the statistical method used to derive the transfer function and in this work a comparison of how these different methods perform is made.

In this work, we compare five methods for predicting the surface geoelectric field given measurements of the surface geomagnetic field. 

Method 1: A surface impedance computed from a pre-existing 1-D model of conductivity, $\sigma$, versus depth, $d$

\begin{equation}
Z_{xy}(\omega) = Z_{yx}(\omega) = f(\sigma(d),d,\omega)
\end{equation}

where the function $f$ involves the use Wait's recursion formula (Wait [1954]; see also formula 2.33 of Simpson and Bahr 2005). $E_x(\omega)$ and $E_y(\omega)$ are computed using

\begin{equation}
E_x(\omega) = Z_xy(\omega)B_y(\omega} 
E_y(\omega) = Z_yx(\omega)B_x(\omega} 
\end{equation}

and then $E_x(t)$ and $E_y(t)$ are computed from the fourier transforms of $E_x(\omega)$ and $E_y(\omega)$, respectively.

Method 2: Using $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ measurements and solving for $\mathbf{Z}$ in

\end{equation}
\mathbf{E(\omega)} = \mathbf{Z(\omega)}\mathbf{B(\omega)} 
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{B} = (B_x,B_y)^T, $\mathbf{E} = (E_x,E_y)^T, and

\mathbf{Z} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_xx & Z_yx
Z_xy & Z_yy
\end{bmatrix}

using using linear least squares regression (Sims 1971; Simpson and Bahr 2005).

Method 3: Using $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ measurements and solving for $H_{xy}$ and $H_{yx}$ in

E_x(t) = \Delta_{xy} + \sum_{\tau=-Na+1}^{Nc}H_{xy}{t-\tau}B_{y}(t)
E_y(t) = \Delta_{yx} + \sum_{\tau=-Na+1}^{Nc}H_{xy}(t-\tau)B_{x}()

using linear least squares regression, where $Na$ and $Nc$ are the number of acausal and causal terms respectively.  

Method 4: Same as method 2 except instead of linear least squares regression, a robust regression method and an auxiliary remote reference measurements to reduce bias is used (Egbert and Booker, 1986; Chave and Thompson 1989).

In principle, impedance tensors developed for magnetotelluluric purposes can be used for prediction as $\mathbf{Z}$ is mathematically related to $\mathbf{H}$ via a fourier transfrom. 

A disadvantage of frequency domain methods is that they may have acausal terms, which makes direct interpretation of the impulse response difficult.
